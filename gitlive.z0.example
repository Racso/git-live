# Example GitLive configuration file
# Rename this file to gitlive.z0 and customize for your project

# The URL of the public LIVE repository where tagged releases will be published
# Can also be provided via --url=<url> CLI argument or GITLIVE_URL environment variable
public-url = https://github.com/user/public-repo.git

# Authentication (optional)
# Username for git authentication - can be provided via:
#   - CLI argument: --user=<username>
#   - Environment variable: GITLIVE_USER (recommended for security)
#   - This file: user = <username>
# user = myusername

# Password for git authentication - can be provided via:
#   - CLI argument: --password=<password> (NOT recommended for security)
#   - Environment variable: GITLIVE_PASSWORD (recommended for security)
#   - NOTE: Password cannot be stored in this file for security reasons

# File Selection Rules
# Rules are evaluated in order:
# - If first rule is add (+): start with empty selection, only explicitly added files included
# - If first rule is remove (-): start with all files, only explicitly removed files excluded
# - Add (+) rules include matching files
# - Remove (-) rules exclude matching files

# Example 1: Sync only specific file types (start empty, add specific files)
files:
# = + *.md
# = + *.txt
# = + src/*.cs
# = - src/*Test.cs
# = + assets/*.png
# = - assets/logo-draft.png

# Example 2: Sync everything except secrets (start with all, remove specific files)
# files:
# = - secret.txt
# = - internal/
# = - *.key
# = - .env
# = - bin/
# = - obj/
